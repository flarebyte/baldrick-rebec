note: |-
    Performance: role-scoped listing queries use an index on role_name and sort by
    updated DESC to keep recent boards cheap to fetch. Pagination defaults (limit,
    offset) avoid large scans. List-with-refs joins are limited to display fields
    and kept optional to minimize row expansion.
