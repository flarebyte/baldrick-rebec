note: |-
    Sync a blackboard and its stickies between a DB id and a folder. We ensure
    safety with a strict direction model (id→folder or folder→id), a security guard
    for foreign ids, dry-run previews, and timestamp/hash checks to avoid clobbering
    newer data. Block-scalars are used for human/AI-friendly YAML.
