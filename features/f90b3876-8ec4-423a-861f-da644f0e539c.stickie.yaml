note: Sync a blackboard and its stickies between a DB id and a folder. We ensure safety with a strict direction model (id→folder or folder→id), a security guard for foreign ids, dry-run previews, and timestamp/hash checks to avoid clobbering newer data. Block-scalars are used for human/AI-friendly YAML.
