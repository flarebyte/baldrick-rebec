note: |-
    Export format: blackboard.yaml plus one *.stickie.yaml per stickie. Background
    and guidelines use literal YAML blocks (|) with ~80-column wrapping; stickie
    note is also wrapped for readability. Complex names provide stable addressing;
    folder→id sync enforces a foreign-id guard. The --force-write flag can rewrite
    files even when timestamps suggest they are current.
