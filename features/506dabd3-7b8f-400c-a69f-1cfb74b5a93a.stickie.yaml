    DAO functions: UpsertBlackboard (insert/update with NULL handling),
    GetBlackboardByID, ListBlackboards (role-scoped, updated DESC),
    ListBlackboardsWithRefs (joins tasks/projects/conversations for display),
    DeleteBlackboard. Types use sql.Null* for optional fields. Queries favor
    predictable ordering and minimal columns to reduce allocation and I/O.
