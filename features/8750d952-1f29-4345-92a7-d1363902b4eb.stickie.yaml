    Table schema: blackboards(id UUID PK, role_name TEXT, conversation_id UUID?,
    project_name TEXT?, task_id UUID?, background TEXT?, guidelines TEXT?, lifecycle
    TEXT?, created TIMESTAMPTZ, updated TIMESTAMPTZ). FKs: conversation_id →
    conversations.id, (project_name,role_name) → projects, task_id → tasks. A
    trigger maintains updated on any update. No dependency on stores; boards are
    scoped by role. Rationale: fewer joins, faster lookups, simpler mental model.
